    # Certbot will set up a 80->443 redirect, however for certbot to bootstrap
    # we'll first need a regular :80 access route. And we cannot setup :443 at
    # this point since we have no SSL cert. So, since certbot will simply
    # recycle this config for the 443 vhost we can confidently converge a
    # http vhost and let certbot fix it up to ssl vhost.

    # WARNING: as a result of leaning on certbot updates to the template here
    # are not reflected in the SSL clone of it!
    # Needs updating in both places manually unfortunately.
